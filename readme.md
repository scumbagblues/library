# Library Application

I use laravel homestead for this develop. Vagrant, angularjs and bootstrap and laravel 5.2 in the backend. 

1.- Install NPM

2.- Install bower 

3.- Running npm install

4.- Run bower update

5.- Create .env file with the basic laravel configuration 

5.- Create a database called "library"

6.- Restore the library.sql dump

7.- You need to create a virtual host called "library.app" if you use laravel homestead

8.- Application link: http://library.app/app/#/books (in case that the stack is Laravel Homestead w/ vagrant)
